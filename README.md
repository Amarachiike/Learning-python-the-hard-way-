# Learning-python-the-hard-way-
When starting my data analytics journey, this was my very first project in python. i used the book learning python the hard way. it is very comprehensive for a beginner. as the name might imply, it is not hard actually but very easy to process. Here it talked about how to properly comment while writing a code. it also stated how to use the printing statement, how to define variables e.t.c.
i recommend that beginners in python should use this book to do their project while kickstarting your journey.
